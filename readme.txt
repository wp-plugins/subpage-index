Shortcode providing an index of subpage pages of the current page

== Description ==

The Subpage Index plugin was developed by [Acumen](http://www.acumendevelopment.net/ "Acumen Development")
in order to provide users with a simple way to include an index of subpages (or 'subpage' pages)
within a given page on their site.

Once the plugin is installed, simply use the [subpageindex] shortcode in your page, and this will be replaced
with an index of subpage pages when visitors hit that page.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin to it's own directory within `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the [subpageindex] shortcode to a page with subpage pages
1. Contact us with your feedback!
